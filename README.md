The website is static, as it is hosted solely on GitHub pages. The pages are generated through Python scripts using database files located in src/database/.

You can build the project by running main.py from the src folder. This extracts all the necessary files to parent folder of src. Building src recreates the whole codebase (except CNAME, LICENSE, and README.md files), therefore you should make your changes only in src.
